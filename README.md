# Game-of-Thrones-Dataset
Game of Thrones Dataset for narrative structure extraction through scene linking

There is a csv file that have a 444 total number of scenes with 16 columns to characterize scenes. The dataset have columns that are self descriptive. There are two scene story titles, the specific_story ans scene_Story, both of them works but the specific story titles are more story oriented than the other.

You can use the utility.py file to do the following:
1. Generate one hot encoding of the important datas such as speaking characters, appearing characters, keywords, entity mentions.
2. Generate TF-IDF reprenetation of the important datas such as speaking characters, appearing characters, keywords, entity m√πentions.
3. Generate document embeddings using pretrained doc2vec model of the scene texts
4. Generate sentence embedding of using BERT transformer model for the texts of each scene
